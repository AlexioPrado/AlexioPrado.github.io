                <li><strong>Reading</strong>
                    <br>
                    When I have the time, I will read on my bed at night till the morning.
                    I usually read adventure, fantasy, or romance novels. 
                    However, everytime I read, I go overtime and wake up late for school.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gaming</strong>
                    <br>
                    I play A LOT during the afternoon. 
                    It usually is the cause to derailing my studying time and work time for school.
                    I find a lot of enjoyment in doing so, I doesnt bother me.
                    I play mostly by my self but many times with my friends and my sister.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Writing</strong>
                    <br>
                    Whenever, I daydream, it mostly involves me dreaming of a hypothetical world or character that I made, which is kinda weird.
                    To keep these ideas saved, I write what I thought of. Its mostly world builing and also character description.
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Drawing</Strong>
                    <br>
                    I love to draw doodles around my school work, especially Jank Boteko and cats.
                    To accompany my writing, I draw maps or characters as well to help me visualize what the world looks like. 
                </li>
                <li><Strong>Arts & Crafts</Strong>
                    <br>
                    As the president of Art Club, I love to create stuff together with my friends and see the finish product.
                    Many of our projects included creating celebrities in the form of turkeys, a pen sign for a turkey named Donatella Versace, and garlands for a fall fest.
