                    <p>
                    I am Marcus Prado. Born in the Philippines, I was raised in Singapore and North Carolina.
                    My favourite subjects have always been Math and Science. I find satisfaction in solving problems during math and loved learning Chemistry and Biology. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, I love to show my creative side in everything I do.
                    My love for art seeped into my studies and I plan to pursue a career that brings out my analytical side and creative side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the future, I would like to pursue a career in civil engineering or architecture.
                    Architecture allows me to be creative in creating designs of buildings and civil engineering is physically constructing the plans from just an idea to reality.

                        A personal project for Python class to create a game.
                        This game used ascii code to visualize cards and earned points based on the cards symbol, number, and color.
                        It tracked attempts of the user and attempts can be earned based on the guess of the user.
